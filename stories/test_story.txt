The village of Aelmont sat nestled in the shadow of the great cliffs, where the ocean roared against the rocks and the wind howled like a living thing. The people of Aelmont had long told stories of the Hollow Wind—a voice carried through the sea air that whispered to those who listened too closely. It was said that once the Hollow Wind called your name, you would never truly belong to the world again.
For years, Taryn had dismissed such tales as superstition. As the daughter of a fisherman, she had spent her childhood on the docks, watching the waves, learning to read the shifting moods of the ocean. Yet, when the wind blew through the village streets late at night, she felt something stir deep in her bones—a voice, distant and wordless, tugging at the edges of her mind.
Her father, old and weary, warned her never to answer the wind. "It doesn’t call without reason," he would say. "And those who answer don’t return the same."
But Taryn was restless. She had grown tired of the narrow paths of Aelmont, of the same tides, the same sunrises. She wanted something more, something just beyond the reach of her understanding. And so, when the Hollow Wind came one autumn night, whispering through the eaves and sending the lanterns flickering, she stepped outside to listen.
The wind curled around her, soft and insistent, and though she could not make out words, she understood the meaning: Follow.
She walked through the empty streets, past the shuttered homes and the silent docks, until she reached the edge of the cliffs. The sea stretched below her, a vast, unbroken darkness. The wind howled through the stone, and she felt the pull of it—not just in her ears, but in her chest, in her soul.
And then, for the first time, she saw it.
Far out at sea, where the horizon met the sky, a light flickered. Not the light of a ship, nor the distant glow of another village. It was something else, something older. It pulsed like a heartbeat, slow and steady, and with every beat, the wind grew stronger.
Taryn stepped forward. The cliffside crumbled beneath her feet, but she did not fall. The wind caught her, held her, carried her forward. The village vanished behind her, and the ocean opened before her, vast and infinite.
She did not remember the journey—only the feeling of being weightless, unbound by the laws of the world she had known. And then, suddenly, she was standing on something solid, though no land lay beneath her feet.
The light rose before her, a great beacon of swirling color and sound. It was not fire, not metal, not anything she had ever seen before. It was song—the voice of the Hollow Wind made manifest.
And it spoke.
"You have come far, seeker. Tell me, do you wish to return, or will you learn the truth?"
Taryn did not hesitate. "The truth."
The light flared, and the wind roared, and in an instant, she saw.
She saw Aelmont as it had been long ago—a place built not by fishermen, but by those who had once walked between worlds. She saw the great ships that sailed not on water, but on the currents of the wind itself. She saw the Hollow Wind as it truly was—not a voice of malice, but of memory, a guardian of those who listened.
She saw herself—not as she had been, but as she was meant to be.
The visions stretched beyond time. She saw the first people who answered the Hollow Wind, drawn into its whispers as she had been. They had learned the hidden currents, how to step beyond the world and into something greater. Some had returned, changed and knowing. Others had disappeared, consumed by the song, or perhaps embraced by it.
Taryn felt herself drifting into that space, into a current she had no name for. If she let go, she would become one of them—one of those lost souls who belonged to the wind. But something inside her anchored her still to the world she had known.
As the wind wrapped around her, it whispered names—thousands of them, stretching back to the beginning of time. She was not the first to stand in this place, and she would not be the last. She saw glimpses of others—wanderers like her, answering the call. Some had been lost to history, others had changed the course of the world in unseen ways.
Memories that were not her own flooded her mind. She saw the first ships that had set sail into the Hollow Wind, vanishing beyond the horizon and never returning. She felt the sorrow of those who had listened too closely, those who had given themselves to the wind without knowing what lay beyond. And she felt the weight of the choice before her—the same choice that had been offered to all before her.
"What lies beyond?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.
The Hollow Wind did not answer in words, but in feeling. A vastness, an endless horizon, a place where time unraveled and the known world faded into something new. A place of possibility. A place of forgetting.
Taryn clenched her fists. She had always wanted to leave Aelmont, but she had never considered what it might mean to go somewhere she could never return from. If she stepped forward, she would belong to the wind. If she turned back, she would wake to the same tides, the same village—but with the knowledge of what she had seen.
She hesitated longer now, feeling the immense force of the wind pulling her in different directions. She saw the faint outlines of those who had stepped forward before her, their forms blurred, their voices singing in harmony with the wind. They were not lost, not entirely. They had become part of something vast.
For a moment, she envied them. To let go, to surrender to the wind, to leave behind the burdens of the world. It was so tempting. But what would be left of her if she did? Would she simply become another whisper in the wind, her name fading into the currents? She tried to picture herself among them, her form dissolving, her thoughts becoming part of something vast and unknowable. Would she remember Aelmont? Would she remember herself? But then she thought of her father, the life she had known, the love and sorrow and humanity of it all.
Her heart pounded. She took a step forward. The light flared, the wind howled, and she felt herself dissolve into the current.
And then, she stopped.
She turned back, gasping, her body trembling as she forced herself to remain. The wind roared around her, angry, pleading—but she planted her feet and closed her eyes.
"Not yet," she whispered.
When she opened them again, she was standing on the docks of Aelmont, the first light of dawn breaking over the horizon. The wind was silent. The sea was calm. And she knew she could never be the same.
She had answered the call. And the Hollow Wind had answered her.
